Step 1: Create a website to increase traffic and activity back to my SoundCloud profile 

Step 2: Profit.

## First Attmept
The homepage will be a collection of items pulled from my SoundCloud and Instagram accounts, using their respective APIs. 

- Pull tracks from a given playlist from SoundCloud
- Pull media from Instagram account
- Spit out items into homepage

## Future Improvements 

- Replace native audio/video elements with custom UI through the HTML5 API
- For each SoundCloud entry, create a static page, pull in track listing and exploit SEO. Ideally automated; worst case scenario a Jekyll type setup with one entry input of #ID. Look into automation through RSS feed
- Sort homepage items by date or random
- Extend SoundCloud/Instagram API integration to post ‘likes’ back to accounts
- Possibly look at wrapping project up in React to make future work easier
- Register Instagram app to avoid sandbox rate limit
