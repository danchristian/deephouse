Step 1: Create a website to increase traffic and activity back to my SoundCloud profile 

Step 2: Profit.

## Initial Idea
The homepage will be a collection of items pulled from my SoundCloud and Instagram accounts, using their respective APIs. For each SoundCloud post, create a static page, pull in track listing and exploit SEO.

## Pipeline 

- Replace native audio/video elements with custom UI through the HTML5 API

- Create way to add static page per SoundCloud entry. Ideally automated; worst case scenario a Jekyll type setup with one entry input of #ID. Look into automation through pulling the RSS feed.

- Sort homepage items by date or random

- Extend SoundCloud/Instagram API integration to post ‘likes’ back to accounts.

- Possibly look at wrapping project up in React to make above items easier and future work easier.

- Register Instagram app to avoid sandbox rate limit.
